    "# Wavefrom Manager Bridge Validation Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Background**</u>: \n",
    "* The Waveform Manager Service provides HTTP endpoints used to query for calibrated waveform channel segments. Waveform Manager Service uses the Waveform bridge component to query wfdisc records and .w files from an Oracle database, translates that data from the legacy CSS data model to the GMS waveform channel segment COI, and returns JSON formatted results to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**What this tool does**</u>: \n",
    "* Validates that data acquired via the Waveform Manager Services matches the expected results from the database tables\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Important Notes**</u>: \n",
    "* REMEMBER to generalize the dbinfo variable with database information before committing  or sending externally;\n",
    "  REMOVE password and db specific information. Efforts will be made in next version to transition to use an Oracle \n",
    "  wallet so this step will no longer be necessary.\n",
    "* Requires obtaining information from WFDISC.dir and WFDISC.dfile to grab relevant .w files. Ideally should be\n",
    "  able to use wpath variable externally \n",
    "    * Before committing or sending externally, remove the real_wpath variable  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Currently the Waveform Manager has two types of OSD endpoints available**</u>:\n",
    "* Retrieve by list of channel names, time range, and optional faceting definition (waveform/channel-segment/query/channel-timerange)\n",
    "* Retrieve by collection of ChannelSegmentDescriptors and optional faceting definition (waveform/channel-segment/query/channel-segment-descriptors)\n",
    "    \n",
    "<u>**Objects available for retrieval from Waveform Manager Service**</u>:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Channel Segments**\n",
    "   * Channel-timerange endpoint: \n",
    "     * Using a list of channels, start time, end time, and optionally a faceting definition returns a collection\n",
    "       of calibrated channel segment waveforms with channels populated as version references. Time range is \n",
    "       inclusive and returns all samples requested by user regardless of which files they came from. Children are \n",
    "       returned based on the provided faceting definition.\n",
    "   * Channel-segment-descriptors: \n",
    "     * Using a collection of ChannelSegmentDescriptors (channel name, segment start time, segment end time, and \n",
    "       segment creation time), and optionally a faceting definition, returns a colletion of calibrated channel\n",
    "       segment waveforms with channels populated as version references. Time range is inclusive and returns all \n",
    "       samples requested by user regardless of which files they came from. Children are returned based on the\n",
    "       provided faceting definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Known issues**:</u> \n",
    "   * Issues with waveform conversion code can create an intermittent zeroing out of e1 converted waveforms \n",
    "     which causes the waveforms to not agree with the database results. This is inherent to JWaveform in that\n",
    "     it does not properly convert e1 formatted waveforms. Comparisons have been made to a python module that \n",
    "     is able to properly convert the files.\n",
    "      * Single microsecond time precision issue in endtimes found for DAVOX (10e-6 error) but seems to be \n",
    "        somewhat of an isolated case, but may have something to do with issue above. \n",
    "   * Waveform JSON format includes extra precision characters from rounding error, bloating message sizes \n",
    "     (fixed in PI17 with CR 26866)"
